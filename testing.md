**Find your course-specific account**
* Open [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
* If you need to reset your password, go to [account lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and follow the prompts. When choosing a new password, click on the Confirm Password field and click enter. 
* If it's successful, enter ssh ACCOUNT_NAME@ieng6.ucsd.edu in VSCode's terminal and enter your password when prompted.

**Install VSCode**
* Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions to download VSCode on your operating system.

**Run Commands**
* I ran several commands like `cd` (change directory), `ls` (list), `pwd` (present working directory) and others to see how they worked.
* To log out of the remote server, use Ctrl-D and the `exit` command.
